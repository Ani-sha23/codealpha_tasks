CodeAlpha Internship Tasks Repository
Welcome to the codealpha_tasks GitHub repository! This repository contains the projects completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship, showcasing fundamental Python programming skills across three beginner-friendly tasks.

Contents of the Repository:
1. Task 1 – Hangman Game
A classic word-guessing game built with Python. The user attempts to guess a randomly selected word by inputting one letter at a time. The game ends when the user either correctly guesses the word or exceeds the allowed number of incorrect attempts. It demonstrates basic logic, loops, and string manipulation.

2. Task 2 – Stock Portfolio Tracker
A command-line Python application that lets users manage a virtual stock portfolio. Users can add, remove, and view stocks along with their real-time prices (using yfinance). It calculates the total portfolio value and gives insight into how portfolios work in real life.

3. Task 3 – Basic Chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and the nltk library. It can respond to greetings and simple queries using predefined response patterns. This task focuses on natural language processing basics and interactive program design.
